% \subsection{Interference over 2\D}

% Doubles are all penalty. 2\N\ is still asking, if available. Responder's bid in one of opener's 3 suits is to play, jump is a mixed raise.

% If opponents double 2\D, \XX\ asks for better major, \P\ to request opener to also \P.

\subsection[2\D--2\protect\N]{2\D---2\protect\N---} \label{2D2N}

3-card majors are shown to make responder declarer.

% \subsection{Mulberry} \label{MB}

% Used for 3-suited hands. For RKC it is necessary for both players to understant what the trump suit is. For the RKC coding, we rank the suits in order of known length in the hand which is responding to RKC. Ties (or unknown) go to the lower suit.
